                <p> From what I understood, progressive enhancement is like the antithesis of graceful degradation, where instead of focusing on the complexity of a project and the final look, progressive enhancement instead focuses on the content and the accessibilitiy of the project.
                PE focuses on the development of a page one layer at a time, from the bare-basics HTML, then to the stylization of CSS, to then the manipulation with JavaScript. With HTML, PE is more concerned on making the page as simple
                as possible so that screen readers and other accessibilitiy tools are easily able to distinguish what's on the screen. CSS then adds some color and style to the page to make it easier to read, while also ensuring that
                the page doesn't disrupt any screen readers from doing their intended purposes. Finally, with JS, users who don't need tools will be able to manipulate the data on the page to their liking, although, JavaScript is 
                likely to break something in the page, and interfere with the abilities of accessibilitiy tools, so a common solution is to enable a prompt to disable JavaScript, so that users who need tools can use them without issue.
                Progressive Enhancement is huge in modern development, with the advancement of the internet and the ever-expanding user pool, web pages must take into account those who aren't able to use the internet without special
                tools. Progressive Enhancement makes this process in including disabled people by ensuring that, as a website is developed, any tools that might be used with the website will still be functional, and, if any errors
                occur during testing, the errors would be easier to find and fix than if a page was developed with gracefult degradation.
