    <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>I have to say, while I do have an awful procrastination habit so my first run of my Dragon website was under pressure, when I sat down with plenty of time to work on the revised website, it was actually enjoyable to an extent.
      I liked being able to design my own website with what I knew and learned over the semester on HTML and CSS. During the development of both the original and the revised SpaceX websites,
      I felt like an actual web developer with established deadlines and requirements, so working on this project, even though it doesn't come close to working professionally on an actual website that will be in use, I got somewhat of 
      an understanding in what goes through the process of web development.
      I feel like, during the course of the semester, even though I had very little experience with HTML and web development, 
      I was able to grasp HTML without too much effort. I understood the syntax of it and I understood how to properly format a page in HTML that would give me minimal errors post-development.</p>
  
      <p>On the other hand, CSS is not my strong suit. It takes me a good long while before I'm able to properly fixate on one property of a document if the document gets a little too complicated, and once I do find it, 
      I kind of struggle as to how I want to style the page. Other times, I can't figure out why exactly, when I stylize an HTML tag with CSS, the page breaks. I'm sure that that's normal for beginners, but I don't know if 
      other people have a hard time like that.</p>
  
      <p>If I had to take the class again, I would definitely spend a lot more time messing with JavaScript and understanding how to implement it into a document. JavaScript seems like a neat concept that I failed to understand properly.
      I don't know how to use plugins correctly and I don't know how to actually use JavaScript for basic functions, like using a slide panel to show or hide a block of text on the click of a button.</p>
  
      <p>On the revision project, I already knew what I had to fix on the website, but I wasn't sure about how the actual content looked. I had two of my friends who have an eye for fashion, design, and basically anything that
      has to do with aesthetics, do a quick skim of all the pages and point out what they think I could improve on. 
      What they would have obviously pointed out was the fact that there was an ugly swatch of gray along the top of the page where the background was supposed to go, and the fact that the SpaceX Dragon
      link at the very top seemed very out of place. Other than that, they liked how I had the pages laid out, saying that the contrast between the black and the dark blue was a nice touch. I myself knew that I had to figure out
      how to replace the background and replace the logo, so that the header wouldn't look so out of place. After that eyesore was fixed, I turned my attention to giving the pages a little touch up, just to make the content a little
      easier to read.</p>
